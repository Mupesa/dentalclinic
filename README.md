# Brightest Smile Clinic - Web Project

This project uses Bootstrap 5 and a custom stylesheet for a clean, responsive design.

## Quick Start

- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Custom styles live in `stylesheet.css`.
- Images are stored in `assets/images/` and referenced in the HTML and CSS.

## Replace Images

All images in `assets/images/` are placeholders downloaded from Unsplash via their source service. Feel free to replace them with your own photos. Keep file names the same or update paths in `index.html` and `stylesheet.css`.

- Hero background: `assets/images/hero.jpg`
- Services: `assets/images/service1.jpg` ... `service4.jpg`
- Team: `assets/images/dentist1.jpg` ... `dentist3.jpg`

## Notes

- Navbar and components are Bootstrap-based. You can customize colors using CSS variables at the top of `stylesheet.css`.
- If you want the mobile navbar toggler to work, include Bootstrap’s JS bundle before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
```
